**Pre-Git Push and Production Deployment Checklist**
======================================================

**Before `git push`:**
--------------------

### Update Integrity File

### 1. Test Your Code

* Run unit tests, integration tests, and any other automated tests to ensure your code is working as expected.
* Perform manual testing to catch any issues that automated tests might miss.

### 2. Code Review

* Have a colleague or peer review your code to catch any errors, improve code quality, and ensure it meets the project's coding standards.

### 3. Check for Conflicts

* Run `git status` to ensure you're working on the correct branch and there are no unexpected changes.
* Run `git pull --rebase` to update your local branch with the latest changes from the remote repository.

### 4. Verify Commit Message

* Ensure your commit message is descriptive, concise, and follows the project's commit message guidelines.

### 5. Check for Sensitive Data

* Verify that you're not committing any sensitive data, such as API keys, passwords, or credit card numbers.

**When Pulling a New Git Version on Production:**
----------------------------------------------

### 1. Backup Your Database

* Take a backup of your production database to ensure you can roll back in case something goes wrong.

### 2. Verify the Deployment Script

* Review the deployment script to ensure it's up-to-date and correct.

### 3. Test the Deployment

* Test the deployment script in a staging or testing environment to catch any issues before deploying to production.

### 4. Monitor the Deployment

* Keep an eye on the deployment process and be prepared to roll back if something goes wrong.

### 5. Verify the Application

* Test the application to ensure it's working as expected after the deployment.

### 6. Check for Errors

* Monitor the application logs for any errors or issues that may have arisen during the deployment.

### 7. Notify Stakeholders

* Inform stakeholders, such as customers or team members, of the deployment and any changes that may affect them.

**Additional Considerations:**
-----------------------------

* Consider using a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate testing, building, and deployment of your code.
* Use a version control system like Git to track changes and collaborate with team members.
* Keep your production environment up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.

Remember to tailor this checklist to your specific project's needs and requirements.
